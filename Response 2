Internet of things (IOT) is an interesting technology now a days. It is new and has lots of people involved in it to understand how to effectively use it to improve user experience. Mobile phones, tablets and smart Tvâ€™s are devices which are commonly used to connect objects to the IOT.
Connecting multiple objects is not easy. Well-designed apps can help with handling connectivity issues. The smooth flow of interactions among devices is difficult to achieve since a small change in one device will propagate across the other devices at the network.
