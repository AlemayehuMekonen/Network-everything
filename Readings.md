Linked:
“Linked” is a very remarkable book. I never thought of seeing network in the perspective of the author, Albert Barabasi. He manages to create a new way of looking at things that we assume are limited to a specific area of life, science or business.  The case of expansion of early Christianity and the case of the cyber-attack on Yahoo shows the importance of network in spreading information. In this twenty first century information is transmitted through the internet. The author claims that Networks are present everywhere and he intend to show how networks emerge, what they look like, and how they evolve (p7).  Meanwhile, the story of Euler’s mathematical work of graphs and networks inspired many mathematicians to focus on networks. The concept of six degree of separation is one of the new concepts that relates to networks.
The six degree of separation is an interesting concept. It made me question if there ever exist things that have no relation on earth. Because as shown in the book, it does not take many links to reach a huge number of friends or pages with in a network. Thus, the concept makes our world a small village or as Albert calls it “small worlds”.  I am convinced with his new way of looking at things that seem unrelated due to the network effect.

Making things talk:
Modems, hubs, switches, and routers are common Connectors.  
A modem is a device that converts one type of signal into another, and connects one object to one other object. Example: DSL modem;  It takes the digital data from my home computer or network, converts it to a signal that can be carried across the phone line or cable line, and connects to another modem on the other end of the line.  
A hub is a device that multiplexes data signals from several devices and passes them upstream to the rest of the network. 

A switch is like a hub, but it’s more sophisticated. It keeps track of the addresses of the objects attached to it, and it passes along messages addressed to those objects only. 

Web server is just a program running on a computer somewhere else on the internet. The server provides access to a number of HTML files, images, sound files, and other elements of a website to clients from all over the world.
A server is a program that provides service to other programs on the internet. The computer that a server runs on is expected to be online and available all times so that the service is not disrupted. 
The server computer shares its IP address with every server program running on it by assigning each program a port number.
