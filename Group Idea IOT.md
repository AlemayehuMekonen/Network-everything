Group 3

Our product is Net-Book. The Netbook allows you to write on it while it saves everything on the cloud. The problem that we are trying to solve is that of managing hard copies of data and backing it up. There are a lot of people who still prefer writing a lot on notebooks rather than laptops or other technical devices. This product is for them. It will allow them to access their data anywhere and create backups of it. All the user has to do is write on it like a normal notebook and let the notebook do the rest.

Behavioral context: Writing notes anytime and anywhere. The Netbook provides lists of recommended activities to do during the day. The Netbook keeps private notes in a separate highly encrypted folder. Also, a voice recognition feature provides additional safety to the users. If the user wants to open notes which are taken a year ago, it automatically opens based on the voice command of the user.  

Ecological: The stakeholders, like big tech companies, are going to invest in our project. In order to do this they will need some capital. To sell our product we will need a network of actors who will distribute it on the target market as well as actors who will manufacture our product. The actors who will distribute our product are shop specializing in technology or big retailers.

Operational: If the person is writing outside, rain and other environmental factors will affect the way in which the product functions. Rain can damage the product. If the person is writing and the weather is too sunny then the reflection on the screen can make it difficult to see.
To keep the product functioning, we will also have a waterproof cover for the device. Moreover, the screen brightness will be adjustable.

Sociocultural: Stakeholder will want a product that will make them profit. That will drive the decision making of the big companies.

Interview questions:

2.How frequently do you use the Net-book service?

3.Draw a spatial map of your usage of notebooks.

We will make it using generative methods by involving non-designers in the process. We will organize events where we call students and other potential users and ask them to brainstorm ideas for what their ideal product would look like. Based on this, we will find out the direction to pursue
