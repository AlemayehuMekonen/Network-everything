The author of this book has an excellent point on how everything is connected with everything else. In the first chapter, he introduced a new scientific field which is based on network. He defined network broadly in a way that surprised me. He assumes that networks exist everywhere. Terrorism, internet, the global economy and other things are all ruled by the basic rules of network formation. Also, the idea of in which the universe has been taken apart by human beings is very interesting. It shows that we are exploiting nature too much to the extent that we cannot reverse things we did to it.
 Chapter two and three have an inspiring story about graph theory and six degree of separation respectively. Euler managed to solve the Konigsberg’s bridge problem, which inspired mathematicians to the discovery of graph theory. And graph theory is the base for the author, Barabasi’s idea of network.  The concept of six degrees of separation, which assumes ‘people are linked by at most five links’, is an interesting theory. As human being, we want to contact our close family or friends even if we are thousands of miles apart. Physical barrier is not limiting us from keeping in touch due to the internet. This shows that the concept of ‘Linked’ is very strong and need to be explored by reading this book in depth.
